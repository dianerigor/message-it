Message IT
============

APRS - Automatic Packet Reporting System, is a location radio system which can be used to capture what’s happening around you.

This project was written in the course "Project Practice" in 2012 (2rd year of university) as a group of five.

Since there is a problem that you don’t always have access to APRS, eg. no internet connection or out of range of radio

Our solution is to build a message transmission system which can turn APRS messages into SMS or email, and vice versa.
